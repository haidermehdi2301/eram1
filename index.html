    <h1>KEYS TO BE HAPPY IN A RELATIONSHIP</h1>
  </center>
  <h3>By Eram Fatima Mirza</h3>
  <p1>Hello youth! Starting from this beautiful quote bya <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Williams_(psychologist)">ROBERT WILLIAMS</a> that says, “I used to think the worst thing in life was to end all alone. It’s not. The worst thing
    in life is to end up with people that make you feel all alone” From this we get to know the issues this generation is going through with all the dating stuff. As you all know these days dating and dating sites are very commonly in use as if it
    became a trend to be dating someone or else you are being labelled as <strong><em>“BACKWARD” OR “NOT COOL”</em></strong>. Due to desperation of the age and fear of being labelled all of that, youngsters may choose wrong people as their mates
    which led to the
    clashes, misunderstanding and more often misconceptions. And because of the unhealthy environment of the toxic relationship affects the mental health as well as physical health in the form of fatigue and exhaustion. Relationship can do good to
    you only if you’re in the right one i.e.<strong>A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP</strong></p1>
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Mental health should be a priority for every one as all of your tasks are depended on it, if you will be mentally exhausted you won’t be able to concentrate on anything and you will become easily irritated. So it’s very important to choose
      correct person to give your time and energy to. If you will you choose the wrong one, then you will fall into a wrong unhealthy relationship destroying you totally from inside.</li>
  </ul>
  <center>

    <p2>So now the most frequent question asked by the youngsters and adults is that <strong>“what does a relationship is consist of?”</strong></p2>
  </center>
  <center>
    <h2>HERE ARE SOME ESSENTIAL BEHAVIORS WHICH A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE CONSIST OF:</h2>
  </center>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>RESPECT:</strong> Love without respect is nothing but just an obsession with nothing inside it, a relationship is hollow if there is no respect in it. Both should respect one another’s personal space and boundaries. Know that both of
      you have your
      own lives and things to do being too much indulged in each other’s life can cause irritation and lack of space for one’s own life.</li><br>
    <li><strong>TRUST:</strong> In a relationship trust works as the back bone, trusting your partner is the main step towards the base of a healthy relationship. For building trust between the partner both should be open about everything to each
      other, hiding
      things from each other even if the intention is not bad can cause unnecessary conflicts causing unhealthy environment.</li><br>
    <li><strong>UNDERSTANDING:</strong> Understanding each other’s decision is the next step towards a healthy companionship always remember controlling and manipulating are the toxic traits and can lead to breakups and depression. Every human has
      the right to
      follow his own decision and being in relationship doesn’t give you the right to control one another’s decision</li><br>
    <li><strong>EMPATHY:</strong> Empathising your partner’s emotions when they are upset or feeling exhausted will build a lot of intimacy between you both which will create sense of comfort and your partner feel emotionally stable which grow the
      relationship in
      so many ways. Having your emotions acknowledged will develop soft corner even when they don’t need the feel to talk they will try to communicate.</li><br>
    <li><strong>COMMUNICATION:</strong> Communication is the key to a successful relationship, communicating your heart out will help you to understand each other on a different level making your relation stronger and unbreakable. Good and necessary
      communication
      will prevent misunderstanding help to maintain cosy and healthy environment</li><br>
    <li><strong>LOVE:</strong> You love each other; you enjoy doing little things with them you feel good with just being with them even if you have nothing to do or say at that time. You feel safe around them even the slightest change in them
      affects you like
      hell. If you both love each other you will do anything to be with each other which is the most important thing a relationship should consist of.

    </li><br>
    <li><strong>COMPROMISE:</strong> Compromise in a relation is as important as understanding, settling the agreement with mutual concession is step towards a good bond and a good relationship. Agreeing with your partner while keeping your own
      beliefs and opinion
      and coming to a mutual agreement is a sign of healthy relation.

    </li><br>
    <li><strong>HONESTY:</strong> Being honest with your partner with all the thing make your trust stronger and unbreakable and assure your partner about your loyalty, one tiniest lie can make your partner question every truth of yours and it’s
      enough to shake
      their trust on you. KEEP IT VERY SIMPLE BY JUST TELLING THE TRUTH.

    </li><br>
    <li><strong>FORGIVENESS:</strong> Its said that you end up forgiving the person you love. Seeking forgiveness and forgiving both are equally important in a relationship to keep it. Realization after a mistake is a healthy sign in a relationship,
      asking for
      forgiveness will make a soft corner in your partner’s heart and make you love even more. </li><br>
    <li><strong>PRIORITY:</strong> Treat your partner as priority not as an option, don’t ever put them aside for any other person. Tell them how much important they are to you frequently. This will assure them and make the trust even more stronger.
      Balance
      should be kept in a relationship as too much of anything can imbalance it which is not a good sign and even cause conflicts</li><br>
    <li><strong>FREEDOM</strong>: Freedom is also an important thing in relationship, if you love them don’t ever try to control them or insist them to do everything through your way because no one should have the right to control one another’s
      decision. They are
      humans and have the full right to be independent as individuality of both shouldn’t be gone while staying in a relationship</li><br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p3>So here are some points to remember while in a relationship, these are the basic and the most important essential behaviours everyone should follow to make relationship stronger and healthy because the person you’re with will decide your
      peace and happiness in the future and it’s very important to choose the right one for you and your future generations because you can choose your husband but your children cannot choose their father.</p3>
