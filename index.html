      Hello youth! Starting from this beautiful quote by 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Williams_(psychologist)">ROBERT WILLIAMS</a>
      that says, “I used to think the worst thing in life was to end all alone. It’s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you feel all alone.” From this, we get to know the issues this generation is going through with all the dating stuff.
    </p>
    <p class="intro">
      As you all know, these days dating and dating sites are very commonly in use, as if it became a trend to be dating someone, or else you are being labelled as <strong><em>“BACKWARD” OR “NOT COOL.”</em></strong> Due to desperation of the age and fear of being labelled, many youngsters may choose the wrong people as their mates, which leads to clashes, misunderstandings, and often misconceptions. Because of this unhealthy environment, toxic relationships affect mental health as well as physical health, leading to fatigue and exhaustion. A relationship can do good for you only if you’re in the right one, i.e., a <strong>A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP.</strong>

      <li>Mental health should be a priority for everyone, as all of your tasks depend on it. If you are mentally exhausted, you won’t be able to concentrate on anything, and you will become easily irritated. So, it’s very important to choose the correct person to give your time and energy to. If you choose the wrong one, you will fall into an unhealthy relationship, destroying yourself from the inside.</li>
    </ul>

      <p class="question">
        So now the most frequent question asked by the youngsters and adults is: 
        <strong>“What does a relationship consist of?”</strong>
      </p>
      <h2>HERE ARE SOME ESSENTIAL BEHAVIORS WHICH A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP SHOULD CONSIST OF:</h2>
    </center>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>RESPECT:</strong> Love without respect is nothing but just an obsession with nothing inside it. A relationship is hollow if there is no respect in it. Both should respect one another’s personal space and boundaries. Know that both of you have your own lives and things to do. Being too much involved in each other’s life can cause irritation and lack of space for one’s own life.</li>
      <li><strong>TRUST:</strong> In a relationship, trust works as the backbone. Trusting your partner is the main step towards the base of a healthy relationship. Building trust between the partners requires being open about everything to each other. Hiding things, even with good intentions, can lead to unnecessary conflicts and an unhealthy environment.</li>
      <li><strong>UNDERSTANDING:</strong> Understanding each other’s decisions is the next step toward a healthy companionship. Always remember that controlling and manipulating are toxic traits and can lead to breakups and depression. Every human has the right to follow their own decisions, and being in a relationship doesn’t give you the right to control one another’s choices.</li>
      <li><strong>EMPATHY:</strong> Empathising with your partner’s emotions when they are upset or exhausted will build a lot of intimacy between you both, creating a sense of comfort. This emotional stability helps grow the relationship. Acknowledging emotions develops a soft corner and encourages healthy communication.</li>
      <li><strong>COMMUNICATION:</strong> Communication is the key to a successful relationship. Communicating your heart out helps you understand each other on a deeper level, making your bond stronger and unbreakable. Good communication prevents misunderstandings and helps maintain a cosy, healthy environment.</li>
      <li><strong>LOVE:</strong> You love each other; you enjoy doing little things together and feel good just being around each other, even without saying much. Feeling safe and secure with your partner is vital for a healthy relationship.</li>
      <li><strong>COMPROMISE:</strong> Compromise is as important as understanding. Settling agreements with mutual concession strengthens the bond. Agreeing with your partner while respecting your own beliefs is a hallmark of a healthy relationship.</li>
      <li><strong>HONESTY:</strong> Being honest with your partner makes trust stronger and unbreakable. Even a small lie can make your partner question every truth, which is enough to shake the foundation of trust. Always keep it simple by just telling the truth.</li>
      <li><strong>FORGIVENESS:</strong> Forgiveness is essential. Asking for and offering forgiveness shows growth and love in a relationship. Realising and apologising for mistakes is a healthy sign and builds a soft corner in your partner’s heart.</li>
      <li><strong>PRIORITY:</strong> Treat your partner as a priority, not as an option. Frequently show how much they mean to you. Balance is key; too much or too little of anything can cause conflicts.</li>
      <li><strong>FREEDOM:</strong> Freedom is crucial. Love them, but don’t try to control them. No one has the right to control another’s decisions. Independence should be maintained even while in a relationship.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="closing">
      So here are some points to remember while in a relationship. These are the basic and most important behaviours everyone should follow to build a stronger and healthier relationship. The person you’re with will determine your peace and happiness in the future, so it’s very important to choose the right one. Remember, you can choose your spouse, but your children cannot choose their parents.
